# Unhandled Non-Numeric Input in Shell Script

This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting:  failure to gracefully handle non-numeric input. The `bug.sh` script attempts to process a file containing numbers, but it crashes if the file contains non-numeric data. The improved `bugSolution.sh` script addresses this by using proper error checking.
